# FakeStore E-Commerce App

This is a React-based e-commerce application built using React, React Router, Axios, React Bootstrap, and the FakeStoreAPI. The app allows users to browse products, view detailed product information, add new products, edit products, and delete products using a mock API.

> **Note:** FakeStoreAPI is a testing/mock API. POST, PUT, and DELETE requests return successful responses, but changes do not persist after refresh.
